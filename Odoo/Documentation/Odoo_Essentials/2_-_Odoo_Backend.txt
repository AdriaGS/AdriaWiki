===== Create a new database =====

Go to https://localhost:8069/web/database/selector, press **Manage databases **and **Create database**. Then, complete the fields to create the new database.


===== Setting up Users and their permissions =====

By default Odoo will set the highest permissions to every new user. To change that we need to:
1. Go to Settings
2. In settings press the General Settings link
3. Scroll down and check the option **Access Rights**

Whenever you create a new User you can now give him/her the permissions that you want leaving in blank the sections the user is not supposed to have access to.

===== Exploring the 'Apps' Menu =====

To install new apps we go to the App tab and we search the app we want to install using filters.

Every time we change the source code of a module we need to **upgrade the module** in order for Odoo to refresh the code base.


===== 'Debug' Mode =====

=== Enable debug mode from settings ===
Go to settings and click the button (Activate the developer mode)

=== Enable debug mode from URL ===
The key word **?debug ** need to be added just after //web// in the URL

==== Why the debug mode? ====

* All the fields have bettwe explanation on them for easier coding and understanding the relations
* Access to the technical features opens a new door for us


===== Fields (column) and Models (table) =====

==== Models: ====

* This is where you should keep your data model, or the algorithms
* You would have the computation engine in your model, you would have the code to save and load your tasks in your model
* THis model class could potentially be reused in other applications

Ex. 
If you write a to-do application, we would keep the data in the model, saved in fields.

==== Fields: ====

* Fields defined in th emodel are basically the columns that you would define in the database
* Check with a simple query the column name against the field name from Odoo view

Ex.
Field name would be the same with the column name if we check in the database on the used table (model)


=== To access the database: ===
1. ''sudo su postgres''
2. ''psql''
3. ''\c demo ''(access the demo database)
4. ''execute some postgreSQL command''
