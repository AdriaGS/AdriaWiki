====== 7 - Overriding Odoo's native functions ======
Created mi√©rcoles 07 noviembre 2018

===== Override create function =====

Every model is created in Odoo has a create function already pre-defined by Odoo, to override it we can enter the following code:

'''
@api.model
def create(self, values):
    if 'name' in values:
        values['name'] = values['name'].upper()
        new_rec = super(PhoneBook, self).create(values)
        return new_rec
'''


===== Override write function =====

Every model is created in Odoo has a write function already pre-defined by Odoo, to override it we can enter the following code:

'''
@api.multi
def write(self, values, context = None):
    if 'name' in values:
        values['name'] = values['name'].upper()
        old_rec = super(PhoneBook, self).write(values)
    else:
        old_rec = super(PhoneBook, self).write(values)
    return True
'''


===== Override unlink (delete) function =====

Every model is created in Odoo has a unlink function already pre-defined by Odoo, to override it we can enter the following code:

'''
@api.multi
def unlink(self):
    for rec in self:
        if rec.name == 'JOHN':
            raise NameError('Record with name john cannot be deleted')
